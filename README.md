# Data Analysis with Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

This project demonstrates how to perform data analysis using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in Python. PCA is a technique used for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction, commonly applied in data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis.

## Description

The main purpose of this project is to showcase how to use PCA to extract meaningful information from data and reduce its dimensionality while preserving its variance. It includes examples of loading data from a CSV file, performing PCA, and visualizing the results.
